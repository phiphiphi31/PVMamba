## üìú Introduction

Mamba, an architecture with RNN-like sequence modeling of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated promising capabilities in long-range modeling with high efficiency. However, Mamba models struggle with structured 2D visual data using sequential computing, thereby lagging behind their attention-based counterparts. In this paper, we propose Parallel Vision Mamba (PVMamba), a novel SSM architecture specifically designed for visual data. PVMamba encompasses two key designs: 1) Based on the sparsity and adjacency of visual signals, we parallelize the sequential computing through three core steps, termed Dynamic State Aggregation (DSA), i.e., parallelization, alignment, and aggregation. DSA generates the hidden state in SSM by a feasible spatial aggregation, thereby overcoming the inherent sequential constraints. 2) In addition to maintaining linear computational complexity, we apply a dynamic operator to learn the spatial samplings for each hidden state. To further boost the local modeling capability, we restrict the dynamic operator to the neighboring pixels in shallow layers. We also devise a layer multiplexing technique to stabilize the training and reduce the learning redundancy. PVMamba is a versatile backbone network with dynamic operators for various vision tasks, such as image classification and dense prediction.

## üïπÔ∏è SGetting Started

### Installation

The installation tips can also be referred to [VMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba/tree/main). 

**Environment Setup:**

VMamba recommends setting up a conda environment and installing dependencies via pip. Use the following commands to set up your environment:
Additionally, we recommend using PyTorch >=2.0, CUDA >=11.8. But a lower version of PyTorch and CUDA is also supported.

***Create and activate a new conda environment***

```bash
conda create -n pvmamba
conda activate pvmamba
```

***Install Dependencies***

For the SSM library, please do as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd kernels/selective_scan && pip install .
```
For the DCNv4 library, please do as follows:

```bash
cd kernels
unzip DCNv4_op.zip
cd kernels/DCNv4_op && pip install .
cp ./dcnv4.py kernels/DCNv4_op/DCNv4/modules/dcnv4.py
```

***Dependencies for `Detection` and `Segmentation` (optional)***

```bash
pip install mmengine==0.10.1 mmcv==2.1.0 opencv-python-headless ftfy regex
pip install mmdet==3.3.0 mmsegmentation==1.2.2 mmpretrain==1.2.0
```

### üìã Model Training and Inference

**Classification**

To train PVMamba models for classification on ImageNet, use the following commands for different configurations. Add --mesa if you want to use mesa training. 

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 --nproc_per_node=8 --master_addr="127.0.0.1" --master_port=29501 main.py --cfg </path/to/config> --batch-size 128 --data-path </path/of/dataset> --output /tmp
```

If you only want to test the performance (together with params and flops):

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 --nproc_per_node=1 --master_addr="127.0.0.1" --master_port=29501 main.py --cfg </path/to/config> --batch-size 128 --data-path </path/of/dataset> --output /tmp --pretrained </path/of/checkpoint>
```


To train with `mmdetection` or `mmsegmentation`:
```bash
bash ./tools/dist_train.sh </path/to/config> 8
```
